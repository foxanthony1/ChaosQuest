# ChaosQuest
It's an adventure!

The world of Lore is threatened! The delicate balance between Order and Chaos has been disrupted. At night a fell darkness befalls the land and hordes of monsters appear, seeking death and destruction.

Some are even adapting to the daylight...

A Champion is needed. Will you step up to the challenge, master the Chaos and defeat the Chaos Dragon?

A: It's a great pack to play in hardcore modee, but it's nowhere near as difficult as Blood 'N Bones or Madpack 2. It's an adventure, like the Final Fantasy games.


Q: Lycanites mobs are scary!

A: Not really a question but - Lycanites Mobs has an incredible set of configuration files and in ChaosQuest 3/4 of the mobs are disabled along with many other tweaks.


Q: IndustrialCraft sucks!

A: Umm, that's a matter of opinion, but you only have to make a generator, battbox and a macerator to progress in the pack.


Q: I'm a bigshot Youtuber/Streamer. I'm going to play your pack with mob greifing off and keep inventory on. That's cool, right?

A: It's Minecraft you can do whatever is permitted by the EULA, but ChaosQuest wasn't designed to be played like that. Would it really be honest to say you're playing the pack, if you made changes like that? I mean, if you want to be honest...


Q: You should add Tinkers' Construct!

A: Tinkers' is an amazing mod but it doesn't belong in EVERY modpack.
