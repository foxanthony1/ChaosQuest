Tree scythe now works with more leaves from other mods - rubber ic2, biomes o plenty, and more.  Added some config file defaults for mod compatibility with tinkers construct guis.  If Altered Stone config is turned on, tools are crafted with only smoothstone, not variants.  Add recipe to reverse netherwart block.  Sound of launch enchant is less overpowering.  Uncrafting grinder speed is now in config file (cyclicmagic.cfg).  Ocean generator details in config.  New InventoryUpgradeKeepOnDeath config option to change if the extended inventory items drop on death.  Tweak dungeon finder flightpath: slower initially, flies more horizontal when far away, then goes vertical later on.  "

Fix scaffolding not dropping as an item when breaking, and increase recipe output slightly."
	,"1.7.14":"Fix Sack of Holding leaving behind ghost blocks or invisible chests when used to pick up half of a double chest.  Sack of holding now always drops the full sack on the player going both ways (instead of sometimes where the chest was, and sometimes where the player is).  Add error handing to Ender Shears to avoid ticking entity crashes, and make sure Ender Shears drops as an item when it hits a block, or a sheep that has already been sheared, or any non-sheep entity.  "
  	,"1.7.15":"Compatibility: fix Magic Bean not getting harvested by Pams Harvestcraft right-click auto-harvest feature.  Make sure Magic Bean always drops its seed when broken, fully grown or not.  Magic bean now respects drops two random items by default if broken, and respects fortune on tools.  Add a bit Magic Bean loot such as stained glass and hardened clay, a few other things (this helps dilute the really good stuff ... it still currently drops vanilla items only)."
  	,"1.7.16":"Fix potion upgrade recipes not working (ingredients changed to changed to gold & ink sacs instead of redstone/glowstone as workaround for known& reported bug in forge).  Added Hit Deposit mode to storage sack: Hit on a block to change modes, and hit on a container to deposit (if you have enabled it).  Add smelting recipes for End & Nether ores by request in case you silk touch them.  Removed key modifiers from default keybindings, (since in current forge version, the modifier cannot be removed: if you rebind to a single key, and restart,  the modifier from the default gets put back on your new key).  Fix keybindings for Extended Inventory and Inventory Crafting not closing the screens when open.  Add chat message to ender dungeon finder if no spawners are in range.  Fix Ender Book crashing servers when players used it and didn't have enough experience points."

Fix Password Trigger block so it is not instamane (has hardness) and is harvestable by a pickaxe.  Ender Torch recipe now produces 32, up from 8.  "
  	,"1.7.21":"New Machine: Automated User (automated item use / right click).  Tweak tooltips on a few other machines.  "
 	,"1.7.22":"Fix Auto Fisher sometimes crashing when unloading chunks (and getting a null loot table).  Avoid ConcurrentModificationException crashes when using exchange scepters or the piston wand (now uses minecraft's vanilla built in addScheduledTask to avoid modifying server data asynchronously).  Also for these scepters increase cooldown from 8 ticks to 10.  Sack of holding now works with more stuff (for example, the machines from Extra Utilities 2).  Change default value of TerrariaInventoryButtons to false (it has caused issues with several other mods now.  Can still be re-enabled client side) "
 	,"1.8.0":"Uncrafting Grinder: Config blacklists moved from blocks category to modpacks (so no longer visible with ingame config gui);  blacklists now correctly use the modid:itemname string for vanilla and modded items; You can now blacklist an entire modid from the uncrafter.  Also no longer uncrafts enchanted items, or unenchanted items using a recipe that creates an enchanted one (Fixes the progressive automation/nether star exploit);  recipe slightly changed, 3 obsidian instead of 1;  Harvester: processing time now in config file.

Magnet Enchant: It can now be on any piece of gear, not just some tools; also its rarity was changed to VERY_RARE(4), used to be COMMON(1).  Magnet enchant can now reach up to level III; each level increases its range (4 + 4 per level, so level 1 is 8, 2 is 12, 3 is 16).  Fixed missing button tooltips in the Redstone Clock.  Fixed the Redstone Clock not sending block updates to the client.   Redstone Clock can now be set to power zero (0) to turn it off completely.      "

The Harvester and Automated User now connect to pipes/hoppers on all four sides, not just the bottom.  Automatic Fisher now drains RF instead of durability from tools if compatible (Flux-Infused Fishing Rod).

Improved compatibility of many machines interacting with modded item pipes and conduits.  Fixed some automation issues with Hydrator recipes; also reduced fluid cost and tweaked a few recipes.  Fix a conflict that breaks NBT data on crafting items from IC2 and Silent Gems. "
	,"1.10.1":"Add missing recipes and guidebook text.  Fixed fluid pipes and the pump flowing every direction except down.  Pipes will no longer show Empty label when actually flowing.  Reduce block hardness of pipes, and tweak hitbox of pipes to be more accurate.  Pipes tell you which direction they are flowing.  "
	,"1.10.2":"Added Item Pipe and Item Pump.  Fixed Fluid pump flowing in the wrong direction when facing vertically up or down.  Experience Pylon now values 20mb of fluid as 1 exp, which is consistent with all other mods that use experience fluid so it avoids exploits.  "

	,"1.10.10":"New Blocks: Ender Bookshelf, Ender Library, Digital Typewriter, Trash Void.
